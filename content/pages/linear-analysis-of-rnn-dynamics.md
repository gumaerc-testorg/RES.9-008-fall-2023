**Description:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful model for neural and cognitive phenomena. However, interpreting these models can be a challenge. In this tutorial, we will discuss how dynamical systems theory provides some tools for understanding RNNs. In particular, we will focus on the theory and application of linearizing RNN dynamics around fixed points. We will then look at some computational tools that have been developed around this framework.

**Speaker Bio:** Eli Pollock is a fifth year BCS PhD student in the Jazayeri lab. His research focuses on using RNNs to model cognitive processes.
